by Dennis Spreen
http://blog.spreendigital.de/2014/09/13/verysimplexml-2-0/

  1.0 Initial release
  1.1 Removed "extended" quotation marks support, Renamed to XmlVerySimple
  2.0 Added various node types (incl. comments), added iOS/Android compatibility
  1.2 Switched TStringList.Load to TStreamReader
  1.3 LoadFromFile/Stream now checks if header is UTF8
  1.4 Removed ' from node attributes
  1.5 Replaced string access with High/Low(string) for NextGen compiler compatibility
      Compact the XML now by using Options := [doCompact]
      XmlNode:
        Attribute value is now escaped/unescaped
        Attribute['tag'] is now Attributes['tag'] (TXmlDocument compatible), all attributes are found in AttributeList
        Added Name (same as NodeName)
        Moved 'find' procedures over to TXmlNodeList (added stubs accordingly)
      Added TXmlDocument compatible functions:
        NodeValue (same as Text), NodeName (same as Name), Encoding (same as Header.Attribute['encoding']),
        Version (same as Header.Attribute['version']), Options (the only compatible option is [doAutoIdent])
        Xml.AddChild (replaces root node name), Xml.DocumentElement (same as root), Node.FirstChild (same as
        Node.ChildNodes.First), Node.LastChild (same as Node.ChildNodes.Last), Node.NextSibling, Node.PreviousSibling
  1.6 Added comment nodes (see NodeType property)
  1.7 Switched TStringList.Save to TStreamWriter
      Renamed 'Indent' to 'NodeIndentStr' (TXmlDocument compatible)
      Added LineBreak (initalized to sLineBreak (=OS depended), e.g. set to #$0A if you want unix/osx/posix compatible linebreaks)
      Added TXmlDocument compatible functions:
        StandAlone (same as Header.Attributes['standalone'])
  1.8 Added basic doctype nodes (see NodeType property)
      Changed 'Root' to 'DocumentElement' (TXmlDocument compatible)
      Be sure to call Xml.AddChild('root') before adding nodes to Xml.DocumentElement!
      All nodes are now in Xml.ChildNodes (incl. comments and doctypes which may appear before the DocumentElement)
      Supports now loading of XML documents without xml header
      Added property Xml.Xml (same as Xml.Text, TXmlDocument compatible)
      Replaced String operations with character pointers (results in slightly faster loading)
  1.9 Added ntProcessingInstr nodes
      Added quote support for attributes to allow quotes inside attributes (e.g. attrib1='Franky "Gunshot" Gimley')
      Only '<' and '&' are now automatically escaped/unescaped inside node text content
      Added ntText nodes
      Parsing routines modularized
      Tries to detect BOM if no encoding is specified before loading
      Uses ANSI encoding if an encoding is set before loading but it's not 'utf-8'
      A text node is only created if the text consists of anything other than whitespaces/tab/returns
      Added High(String) function for D2010-XE2
      Replaced XMLArray with TXmlNodeList
  2.0 BETA Dropped support for D2009 (because of missing .last, .first, etc. - see wiki for more information)
      Added TEncoding.ANSI for D2010 (redirects to TEncoding.Default, which is with XE2 and above OS dependend!)
      Added CDATA node type
      Added IsTextElement
      Expanded Find routines with NodeTypes
      Added doCaseInsensitive (default: node and attribute names are case sensitive!)
      Removed extra Quote support for attributes
      Escape/Unescapes now all 5 predefined entities (in attributes and nodes)
      Added weak references for nextgen ARCtic compiler
      Adpated TXMLStreamReader to read from the buffered string
      Added WriteBOM option (set by default)

  2.0 Turned Beta 21 into 2.0 Release

  2.0.1 [Fix] NextSibling/prevSibling bug

  2.0.2 Added support for Delphi 10.1 Berlin (replaced class helper with TXmlStreamreader and RTTI)

  2.0.3 [Fix] NodeType was ignored by TXmlNode.InsertChild
	[Fix] Still not supported but better parsing of markup elements lines like !ELEMENT, !ATTLIST and !ENTITY

  2.0.4 [Fix] Fixed fill buffer length

      What's still left to do:
        - update example for FMX/VCL
        - upgrade/update code comments and wiki
